# @backstage/backend-tasks

## 0.3.2-next.0

### Patch Changes

- fde10d24f6: Allow tasks that fail to retry on a loop emitting a warning log every time it fails with the amount of attempts it has
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/backend-common@0.13.6-next.0

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 73480846dd: `TaskScheduleDefinition` has been updated to also accept an options object containing duration information in the form of days, hours, seconds and so on. This allows for scheduling without importing `luxon`.

  ```diff
  -import { Duration } from 'luxon';
  // omitted other code

  const schedule = env.scheduler.createScheduledTaskRunner({
  -  frequency: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 10 }),
  -  timeout: Duration.fromObject({ minutes: 15 }),
  +  frequency: { minutes: 10 },
  +  timeout: { minutes: 15 },
     // omitted other code
  });
  ```

- cfd779a9bc: Scheduled tasks now have an optional `scope` field. If unset, or having the
  value `'global'`, the old behavior with cross-worker locking is retained. If
  having the value `'local'`, there is no coordination across workers and the
  behavior is more like `setInterval`. This can be used to replace usages of
  `runPeriodically` helpers.
- ebbec677e1: Correctly set next run time for tasks
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/backend-common@0.13.3
  - @backstage/config@1.0.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ab008a0988: Adds the ability to manually trigger tasks which are registered

### Patch Changes

- bdd2773202: Refactored the internal `TaskWorker` class to make it easier to test.
- a83babdd63: Fixed the `initialDelay` parameter of tasks to properly make task workers
  _always_ wait before the first invocations on startup, not just the very first
  time that the task is ever created. This behavior is more in line with
  expectations. Callers to not need to update their code.

  Also clarified in the doc comment for the field that this wait applies only on
  an individual worker level. That is, if you have a cluster of workers then each
  individual machine may postpone its first task invocation by the given amount of
  time to leave room for the service to settle, but _other_ workers may still
  continue to invoke the task on the regular cadence in the meantime.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

  - @backstage/types@1.0.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9461f73643: **BREAKING**: The `TaskDefinition` type has been removed, and replaced by the equal pair `TaskScheduleDefinition` and `TaskInvocationDefinition`. The interface for `PluginTaskScheduler.scheduleTask` stays effectively unchanged, so this only affects you if you use the actual types directly.

  Added the method `PluginTaskScheduler.createTaskSchedule`, which returns a `TaskSchedule` wrapper that is convenient to pass down into classes that want to control their task invocations while the caller wants to retain control of the actual schedule chosen.

### Patch Changes

- ab7cd7d70e: Do some groundwork for supporting the `better-sqlite3` driver, to maybe eventually replace `@vscode/sqlite3` (#9912)
- 7290dda9d4: Relaxed the task ID requirement to now support any non-empty string
- ae2ed04076: Add support for cron syntax to configure task frequency - `TaskScheduleDefinition.frequency` can now be both a `Duration` and an object on the form `{ cron: string }`, where the latter is expected to be on standard crontab format (e.g. `'0 */2 * * *'`).
